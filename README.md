### Hej, Kia ora, こんにちは 👋

#### Who am I

👋 Hi there! I'm Jeremy, a French Senior Software Engineer and Team Lead currently based in Tokyo, Japan. My family and I are excited to be starting our next chapter soon with a move to Sweden this October!

🛠️ My path into tech wasn't a straight line. I started my career as a boilermaker in aeronautics, but after 7 years, I knew I needed a change. I went back to school, earned my university degrees in Informatics, and found my true passion in building software and leading teams.

👨‍💻 Professionally, my journey has taken me from software engineering in France, to leading a front-end practice in New Zealand, to my current role as an Assistant Engineering Manager in Tokyo. Here, I have the privilege of leading a team of up to eight engineers at Rakuten, where my focus is on creating a supportive, collaborative environment that empowers them to do their best work. I enjoy balancing technical leadership with my responsibility for my team's career growth and successful project delivery.

🇸🇪 For years, we've been captivated by Sweden's culture of innovation, its beautiful landscapes, and its commitment to equality and inclusion. I'm incredibly excited to immerse my family in a new culture, learn the language, and contribute my skills to Sweden's dynamic tech community.

📚 Outside of work, I like to unwind with a good book (or manga), some painting (miniatures, watercolour), or a bit of writing. I also enjoy gaming in all its forms—from board games to video games and role-playing games. Every mornings, you can also find me starting the day with a gym session.

🔭 I’m currently focused on preparing for our move and finding my next professional challenge in Sweden.

📗 I’m currently learning Swedish and improving my Japanese! And always diving deeper into effective leadership practices and system architecture.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any open-source projects that are fun and have a positive impact.

💬 Ask me about anything from frontend development and team leadership to painting and books!

📫 The best way to reach me is on LinkedIn.
