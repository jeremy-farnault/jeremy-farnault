#### Who am I

👋 Hi there! I'm Jeremy, a French/Kiwi Senior Front-End Developer and Front-End Practice Lead based in Paraparaumu, NZ. I'm 37 and live here with my wife and two kids.

🛠️ Before diving into tech, I was a boilermaker in aeronautics for 7 years. Realizing it wasn't my calling, I took evening classes to earn my high school degree and later my Technology University degree in Informatics. I also have a Master of Science in Informatics from SUPINFO International University.

👨‍💻 Professionally, I've had the privilege of collaborating with Te Whatu Ora (Ministry of Health) on critical COVID-19 response applications. I've also taken on a leadership role at Abletech, where I serve as a bridge between the People Lead and our development team. I'm involved in everything from mentoring to RFPs, and I'm incredibly proud of the work we're doing.

🇳🇿 I was captivated by New Zealand 20+ years ago, ever since Peter Jackson's films showcased its breathtaking landscapes and vibrant culture. I've now called Wellington home for 6+ years. While I previously worked at Jarden, NZ's leading finance company, I'm currently at Abletech, an incredible consulting firm.

🇯🇵 My family and I are also deeply fascinated by Japan, and it's a country we're looking forward to exploring more closely in the future.

📚 Outside of coding, I'm a bookworm with a soft spot for mangas and fantasy literature. I'm also a gaming enthusiast—whether it's role-playing, card games, board games, or video games, count me in! 🎮

🏋️‍♂️ I kickstart my mornings with weightlifting sessions and am passionate about miniature painting 🎨. I've been a vegetarian for 8 years and vegan 🌱 for the last 5.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a medfan book, a react side project, and a react/react-native app in the finance world.
- :green_book: I’m currently learning Japanese, finance and ecology. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any fun open-source project.
- 💬 Ask me about any of my interests :smile:.
