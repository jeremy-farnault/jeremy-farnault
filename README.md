### 🛠️ The Journey
* **Craftsman Beginnings:** Spent 7 years as a **boilermaker in aeronautics** before pivoting to tech. I bring that same precision and "builder" mindset to every system I architect.
* **Global Leadership:** Most recently an Assistant Engineering Manager at **Rakuten** (Tokyo), leading a team of 8. I focus on technical excellence, mentorship, and high-impact delivery.
* **The Pivot:** Moved from France to NZ to Japan, and now to Sweden—navigating diverse tech cultures and scaling engineering practices along the way.

### 💻 Core Focus
* **Frontend & Architecture:** Specialist in scalable, maintainable web systems.
* **People Leadership:** Building "psychologically safe" environments where engineers thrive.
* **Systems:** Passionate about clean code, effective leadership frameworks, and system design.

### 🎨 Off-duty
* **Creative:** Painting miniatures and working with watercolors.
* **Gaming:** Board games, tabletop RPGs, and video games.
* **Active:** I start every morning at the gym to stay sharp.
* **Languages:** Currently mastering **Svenska** 🇸🇪 and keeping my **Japanese** 🇯🇵 fresh.
